        <h4>Superpowers</h4>
        <p>
            Omnipotent(ial) Thanos is immensely strong and resistant to injury, invulnerable to nearly all types of poison, 
            disease, and telepathic attack. He also has incredible psychic abilities; he can sense things several star systems away.

            <li> While Avengers Endgame makes the btask of foiling the Mad Titanâ€™s plans seem insurmountable for obvious dramatic and storytelling purposes, The Green Shaquille is vulnerable.  </li>
            <li> Although Thor and Thanos have faced off against one another on numerous occasions, the end results of these duels usually meant a humiliating defeat for the God of Thunder. </li>
            <li> Fire Lord presented Thor with a set of Asgardian armor and weaponry that Odin had forged himself. </li>
            <li> Armed with the Instruments of War, Belt of Power, and Odin Force, Thor managed to defeat Thanos by crashing Mjolnir on his head. </li>
